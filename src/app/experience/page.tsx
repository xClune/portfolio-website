      <p className="px-5 md:pl-2 md:pr-14">
        I began my career as a civil engineer, working the majority of my first
        4 years with Transport and Main Roads Queensland. This role gave me a
        strong foundation in project management, stakeholder engagement, and
        technical skills.
      </p>
      <p className="px-5 md:pl-2 md:pr-14">
        After these 4 years, I decided that I wanted to learn more and made the
        decision to pivot my career towards software development. This was done
        in conjunction with a period of travel, in which I was fortunate enough
        to find roles in different fields across different countries.
      </p>
      <p className="px-5 md:pl-2 md:pr-14">
        With this travel period coming to an end, and my desire to move back to
        the Sunshine Coast I have pushed forward with web development and
        computer science online studies. Most recently completing the Havard
        CS50x course.
